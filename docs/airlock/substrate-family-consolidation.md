# Substrate Family Consolidation Docket

**Date:** 2026-07-29
**Auditor:** Forge-Code (autonomous consolidation pass)
**Status:** MIGRATION PROPOSED — awaiting squash approval

---

## Members in Scope

| Repo | Default | Branches | Last Push | Local Clone |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `substrate` | main | **100** | 2026-07-29 | ❌ |
| `substrate-adapters-bundle` | main | 7 | 2026-07-29 | ❌ |

## MIGRATE — semantic content mapping

| Source | Target | Rule | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `substrate` | canonical | n/a | 100 branches; public; canonical substrate ecosystem repo |
| `substrate-adapters-bundle` | canonical | n/a | 7 branches; meta-repo of substrate adapter crates (git-submodule pointers); review/ownership branches indicate recent governance work |

**Cross-branch collision scan result: ZERO common branch names.**
`substrate` and `substrate-adapters-bundle` are **independent repos** — neither duplicates the other.

(plus many more gateway-* branches and AIRLOCK archive branches not enumerated)
```

**Heaviest repo in scope.** 100 branches include:
- 2 `airlock-archive/wave4/*` tarball snapshots
- 3 `archive/thegent-dispatch/*` absorbed sub-repo branches
- `chore/release-v0.3.*` release branches
- `chore/rebase-substrate-*` rebase work branches
- 30+ `feat/gateway-*` feature branches
- `dependabot/*` automated dependency bumps
- `cursor/*` AI-assist session branches

### substrate-adapters-bundle (7 branches)

```
main
review/ownership-20260722-approved-next
review/ownership-20260722-pheno-agents-md
review/ownership-20260722-pheno-context
review/ownership-20260722-pheno-otel
review/ownership-20260722-phenoUtils
review/ownership-20260722-substrate-config
```

The 6 `review/ownership-20260722-*` branches indicate a recent ownership/governance audit on 2026-07-22; all merged into `main` per branch naming pattern.

## STATE — current branches

100 vs 7 branches; ZERO overlap. Both repos publicly accessible.

## ABSORBED — confirmed content states

- **substrate-adapters-bundle** is a meta-repo (per its description). It does NOT contain the substrate adapter crates itself; it points at them via git-submodule references and a curated README list.

## SUPERSEDES — receipts preserved

Neither repo is an archive of the other. Both retain full history independently.

## PROPOSED MUTATIONS (NOT EXECUTED — pending approval)

1. `substrate` → squash to 1 commit on `main` (preserve branch metadata in commit body).
2. `substrate-adapters-bundle` → squash to 1 commit on `main`.

**WARNING — HIGHEST branch count in scope**:
- 100 branches on `substrate`, including 2 tarball snapshots, 3 archive branches, 30+ gateway features, dependabot, cursor session branches, etc.
- A naive `git reset --soft` to 1 commit will **flatten ALL** of these into the single commit body. Branch metadata will be retained as text content; commit content may miss details.
- **Recommendation**: Before squash, run `git for-each-ref refs/heads/ --format='%(refname:short) %(objectname:short) %(committerdate:short) %(subject)' > branches-pre-squash.txt` and stash that file in `AgilePlus/docs/airlock/substrate-branches-manifest-pre-squash-2026-07-29.txt`. This is the receipt.

## LOCAL CHECKOUT COVERAGE

- ❌ Neither repo has a local clone.
- All 100 branches live on `origin`; no risk of local loss.
- Shallow clone of both required before any mutation (or API-only operations).

## RISK CLASS

**Low (for collision), HIGH (for squash complexity).**
- Branch-collision scan: clean.
- Squash complexity: 100-branch manifest + tarball snapshots requires careful receipt-keeping before merge.

## NEXT CHECKPOINT

User must approve:
- (a) shallow-clone of both repos for receipt-keeping
- (b) branches-manifest export before squash
- (c) final squash of each to 1 commit on `main`
